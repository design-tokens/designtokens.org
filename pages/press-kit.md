# Press Kit
Guidelines and assets to help the public talk about the Design Tokens W3C Community Group. The press kit allows anyone such as speakers, bloggers, YouTubers, and newsletter authors to share our work.


## About the Design Tokens W3C Community Group
The Design Tokens W3C Community Group means to develop standards in the way stylistic values of a design system are stored in a design token, which creators, products, and designs tools can reliably create and share.


Refer to this group as:
- Design Tokens W3C Community Group
- DTCG

Note: the DTCG is not a W3C Working Group. The technical reports published by the DTCG are not W3C Standards nor are they on the W3C Standards Track.
